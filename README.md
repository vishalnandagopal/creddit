# reddit-cli

An unofficial cli client for Reddit, aimed at people who regularly browse specific subreddits or topics instead of reading the homepage (r/all).

### Features:
- Distraction free. Can browse a few posts and continue with your day. No flashy gifs, awards, ads or posts.

- Browse a subreddit by entering just the name.

- Prints a link to the article mentioned in every post, for you to continue reading it in your browser (`ctrl+click`), in case you are interested.

- Can browse top comments for every post just by entering the number shown beside the post in the terminal.

Feel free to send a PR with any additional features, or make an issue if you have any feature requests!

### How to use?

Just install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. It should work in your main environment since the dependencies are already common.

Then run

```sh
python app.py
```

### To add

More guidance on MPV, and alternatives if it isn't installed
