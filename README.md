# creddit - A CLI client for Reddit

An unofficial cli client for Reddit, aimed at people who regularly browse specific subreddits or topics instead of reading the homepage (r/all).

### Features:
- Distraction free. Can browse a few posts and continue with your day. No flashy gifs, awards, ads or posts.

- Browse a subreddit by entering just the name.

- Prints a link to the article mentioned in every post, for you to continue reading it in your browser (`ctrl+click`), in case you are interested.

- Can browse top comments for every post just by entering the number shown beside the post in the terminal.

Feel free to send a PR with any additional features, or make an issue if you have any feature requests!
